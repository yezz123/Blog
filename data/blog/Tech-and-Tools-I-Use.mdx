![Tools](/static/images/blog/13/01.png)

A list of tools I use whether for:

- Personal side projects
- My full time job

## Code

The code editor I'm currently using is VSCode, but sometimes while using Ubuntu, i use Sublime Text.

### stacks

- Primary stack:

  - Django.
  - Serverless functions written in Python (when required).
  - API intergration with Python (when required).
  - Test intergrations (ex. pytest, unittest, etc).
  - Markdown, Yaml, Json etc... (when required)
  - Tools like: Celery, Redis, Postgres, etc...

This stack mostly i use it while building my opensource projects or with some clients i work with.
